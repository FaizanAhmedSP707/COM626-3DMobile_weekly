	The purpose of this folder is to notify the user that the folder called  'LifecycleMapsStarter' is actually
	a clone of the tutor's repository, hence changes cannot be pushed to it. If the folder receives new changes
	by changing something code-related or some folders that are renamed, then the changes will only be visible
	on the owner's local machine. It maybe best to create a fork of the tutor's repository, copy and paste the
	changes from the folder mentioned above, and then see all the changes on GitHub.
